"""
rapidmeta_count_harness.py — pre-condition checks for per-arm 2x2 event-count extraction.

Purpose
-------
Every check in this file exists because the mistake it catches was actually made,
in this programme, on real data. The harness turns those lessons into gates that
run before an extraction is allowed downstream, instead of paragraphs in a memo
that the next lane will not read.

Design rules
------------
1.  FAIL CLOSED. A cell that cannot be shown to be safe is BLOCK, not PASS.
    Missing information is never treated as reassurance.
2.  A BLOCKED FETCH IS NOT AN ABSENCE. Retrieval failure is recorded as
    obstacle=<reason> and raises; it never becomes events=None / "not reported".
3.  READ, NEVER COMPUTE. Any cell whose provenance is not "read" is blocked.
    The harness will not multiply a percentage by a denominator for you, and it
    blocks cells that admit to having done so.
4.  Stdlib only. No install step, so the next lane can actually run it.

Usage
-----
    python rapidmeta_count_harness.py --selftest
    python rapidmeta_count_harness.py extraction.json
    python rapidmeta_count_harness.py extraction.json --report report.md --json result.json

Exit codes: 0 = no BLOCKs, 1 = one or more BLOCKs, 2 = usage/parse error.
