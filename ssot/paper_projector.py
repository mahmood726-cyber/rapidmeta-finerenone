"""PROJECT A MANUSCRIPT FROM AN SSOT OBJECT. Every sentence names the field behind it.

WHY THIS IS PROJECTION AND NOT THE INVENTION I REFUSED HOURS AGO. Earlier tonight the objects
held nothing a manuscript could be made of, and writing one would have been fabrication. They
now hold an executed search with its queries and PRISMA counts, a criteria block with sourced
elements, a screening disposition for every surfaced trial, pooled estimates with verbatim
model output, and the estimand reasoning. A manuscript rendered from those is a VIEW of the
object, and every sentence in it can be traced back to the field it came from.

    THE RULE IS THE CRITERIA-DERIVATION RULE, UNCHANGED: A SECTION WITH NO FIELD BEHIND IT DOES
    NOT GET WRITTEN. The tab keeps refusing for that section rather than filling it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THREE PROPERTIES KEPT FROM `F:\\allmeta\\paper\\assets\\js\\paper-studio.js`, AND ONE INVERTED.

KEPT 1 -- IDENTITY JOIN, NEVER POSITIONAL. Its own comment records why: "Effects are joined to
records by identity in the bridge, not by position." That is the same defect class as reading
`outcomeMeasures[0]` -- and this repository has now met that class twice in one night, so the
join here is on registration id and a record whose id does not resolve is REPORTED, not
silently dropped and not silently paired with its neighbour.

KEPT 2 -- OMIT-IF-MISSING. `buildResultsNarrative` states it: "Omits any sentence whose key
values are missing so nothing is fabricated." Every sentence below is emitted only if its
field is present, and the absent ones are listed by name.

KEPT 3 -- HOUSE STYLE AS A PARAMETER, NOT A FORK. One projector, a `journal` and a `length`
parameter, no per-journal copies to drift apart.

INVERTED -- AND THIS IS THE ONE THAT MATTERS. In paper-studio, THE LENGTH DROPDOWN GENERATES
PROCEDURAL CLAIMS. Selecting a longer Methods emits, from no field whatsoever:

    len != "concise"   "Two review authors independently screened records and extracted data,
                        resolving disagreements by discussion."
    len != "concise"   "...study selection and data extraction performed in duplicate."
    len == "detailed"  "Reporting followed the PRISMA 2020 guidance, and the review methods
                        were specified before data collection."
    always             "Risk of bias was assessed using RoB 2, and certainty of evidence using
                        GRADE."                       (`c.rob` defaults to "RoB 2" via `|| `)
    len != "concise"   "Between-study variance (tau^2) was estimated using a random-effects
                        (DerSimonian-Laird) model"    (regardless of the estimator actually used)

    A FORMATTING CONTROL THAT ASSERTS TWO INDEPENDENT REVIEWERS, DUPLICATE EXTRACTION, A
    PRESPECIFIED PROTOCOL AND A NAMED RISK-OF-BIAS TOOL IS MANUFACTURING THE METHODS SECTION.
    It carries an author-facing "please confirm" note, which is a hedge and not a gate: the
    sentence is in the document, in the author's voice, whether or not anyone confirms it.

Methods is the easiest place in a manuscript to write fluent sentences asserting procedures
nobody performed, so here LENGTH CHANGES ONLY HOW MUCH OF WHAT IS RECORDED IS SAID -- never
what is asserted. If the object does not record that something was done, this does not say it
was done. There is no `|| "RoB 2"` anywhere in this file.
